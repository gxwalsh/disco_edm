# DisCo EDM ReadMe

## Intro
Distributed Co-Design tool with Enhanced Design Management was created to facilitate synchronous and asynchronous collaboration in geographically distributed environments. This project was originally started as DisCo in 2010 but was based entirely in ActionScript and only worked as an asynchronous collaboration tool. This version, DisCoEDM, was built from the ground up to support multiple device types, real-time collaboration, and ease of use.


## Installation


### Requirements

This project is dependent on several other technologies:

- [PHP Ratchet](http://socketo.me)
- MySQL or MariaDB

 



## Acknowledgements

This project could not have been possible without those that helped in the original DisCo project as well as all of the kid and adult participants over the years. 

I also need to thank Stack Exchange for an endless source of code solutions for when I was stuck.


## Roadmap

- Re-design of interface
- Ability to add and manipulate images
- Implementation of interactive layers that enable muting, soloing, and highlighting for design analysis.
- Better note system for design ideas.


## Further Information
